						In a sport game between two teams, there are only 3 possible outcomes and out of that 3 only one will happen in a single match. All outcomes 
						are mutually exclusive from each other. For example,Team A will only win,draw or lose against Team B, so there is 33,33% chance among 
						each possible outcome. </br> </br> <span>PLACING BETS</span> </br> </br> When a gambler assume that team A will win a match against team B, he/she
						will have 33,33% chances of succeeding which is unlikely to happen but if the gambler assume that team A wins Or draw against team B now 
						the gambler will have 66,66% chances of succeeding which is likely to happen.</br></br> This prediction model aims to provide gamblers with 66,66% 
						chances of winning.</br> </br>The future is unknown for the most part, and in reality can only be predicted (such as the weather).</br> But with the right statical tools the
						future can be predicted more accurately.
